# MorsecodeGUI
a morse code gui made for a scout thing

Designed to run on a raspberry pi, unknown screen size so everything is just based on fractions of the screen and an assumed standard aspect ratio.

## Features still to add:
- A clear button to remove all text from the screen
- A demo mode that displays random scouty words after x amount of inactive time
- Sound
- Auto-update (a call to check this repo on start to check that it's the latest version)
